# Introduction
Iris flower classification is a fundamental task in machine learning, widely used for testing algorithms. This project aims to showcase the application of deep learning in solving this classification problem, providing insights into the potential of neural networks for botanical studies.

# Dataset
The "Iris Data Set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is a classic dataset that includes 150 samples of iris flowers, each characterized by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset spans three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

# Data Preprocessing
Prior to model training, the dataset undergoes essential preprocessing steps. These steps include feature scaling to ensure uniformity across dimensions and encoding the categorical target variable (species) into numerical values. This ensures the dataset is ready for input into the deep learning model.

# Model Training
The deep learning model architecture is designed to accommodate the intricacies of Iris flower classification. With an input layer matching the number of features and appropriate hidden layers, the model is trained on the preprocessed dataset. This section may include details about the choice of activation functions, optimizers, and the rationale behind the architecture.

# Model Evaluation
Model evaluation is a critical step in assessing its performance. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are employed to quantify the model's ability to correctly classify instances. The confusion matrix provides a more detailed breakdown of the model's predictions, highlighting areas for improvement.



- **Accuracy:** 0.7067
- **Confusion Matrix:**
  |             | Predicted Class 0 | Predicted Class 1 | Predicted Class 2 |
  |-------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
  | True Class 0| 25                | 0                 | 0                 |
  | True Class 1| 0                 | 23                | 0                 |
  | True Class 2| 0                 | 22                | 5                 |

# Results and Analysis
